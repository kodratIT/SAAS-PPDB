# Check SchoolContext is wrapping the component
# Verify user has schoolId in Firestore
# Check useSchool() hook is called
```

### Issue: "File upload permission denied"
```bash
# Solution
# Update Firebase Storage rules:
# allow write: if request.auth != null && 
#               request.resource.size < 2 * 1024 * 1024
```

### Issue: "Province dropdown not working"
